This will likely involve creating a new component to display golfer profiles and handle the swipe gestures.\n3.  **Matching Logic:** Develop the matching logic. When two golfers \"swing right\" on each other, they should be considered a match.\n4.  **Messaging:** Create a basic messaging interface.

Here's a breakdown of the design vision and how to address your specific requests for the golf app:\n\n**Features to Add/Modify:**\n\n1.  **Active Tab Indicator:** The green background should dynamically highlight the currently selected tab in the `FloatingTabBar`.\n2.  **Authentication:** Implement a sign-up/login flow to restrict app usage to registered users.\n3.  **UI Adjustment:** Shift the `FloatingTabBar` (Discover, Matches, Profile) and the red/green \"like/pass\" buttons downwards.\n4.  **Button Resizing:** Reduce the size of the red and green \"like/pass\" buttons for better proportionality.\n\nHere's a detailed approach to implementing these features, focusing on the existing codebase:\n\n**1. Active Tab Indicator:**\n\n*   **Modify `FloatingTabBar.tsx`:**\n    *   Use the `usePathname` hook from `expo-router` to determine the current route.\n    *   Within the `FloatingTabBar` component, conditionally apply a green background style to the tab button that matches the current route. You can use the `selectedTab` state and `setSelectedTab` function to manage the active tab.\n\n**2. Authentication:**\n\n*   **Implement Sign-up/Login:**\n    *   Create dedicated screens for sign-up and login (e.g., `app/auth/signup.tsx`, `app/auth/login.tsx`).\n    *   Use Supabase Auth to handle user authentication.\n    *   Store user session data (e.g., in `AsyncStorage`) to persist login status.\n    *   Wrap the main app content with a conditional rendering that checks for an active user session. If no session exists, redirect to the login screen.\n\n**3. UI Adjustment:**\n\n*   **Modify Layout Components:**\n    *   Adjust the styling of the parent container holding the `FloatingTabBar` and the \"like/pass\" buttons. Use `marginTop` or `paddingTop` to shift the elements downwards.\n\n**4. Button Resizing:**\n\n*   **Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n    *   Adjust the `width` and `height` styles applied to the red and green buttons within the `HomeScreen` component. Ensure the new sizes maintain visual balance.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-25T19:23:06.427417"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you implement these changes.

Now let me create a summary of all the changes I've made:\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\nI've successfully implemented all the requested features for your golf app:\n\n### 1. **Active Tab Indicator (Green Background)**\n- Updated `FloatingTabBar.tsx` to use the primary green color (`colors.primary`) for the active tab indicator\n- The green background now dynamically follows whichever tab you're on (Discover, Matches, or Profile)\n- Changed the icon and text colors to white (`colors.card`) when a tab is active for better contrast\n\n### 2. **Authentication System**\n- **Installed dependencies**: `@supabase/supabase-js` and `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`\n- **Created authentication files**:\n  - `lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client configuration\n  - `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Authentication context provider\n  - `app/auth/login.tsx` - Login screen with email/password\n  - `app/auth/signup.tsx` - Sign-up screen with email verification\n  - `app/auth/_layout.tsx` - Auth layout wrapper\n  - `app/index.tsx` - Root redirect based on auth state\n- **Updated existing files**:\n  - `app/_layout.tsx` - Added AuthProvider wrapper\n  - `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Added authentication check that redirects to login if not authenticated\n  - `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` - Added sign-out button and displays user email\n- **Features**:\n  - Users must sign up before using the app\n  - Email verification required (users get an alert to check their email)\n  - Session persistence using AsyncStorage\n  - Automatic redirect to login if not authenticated\n\n### 3. **UI Adjustments (Moved Elements Down)**\n- **FloatingTabBar**: Added `bottomMargin={30}` prop (increased from 20) to move it down\n- **Action Buttons**: Increased `paddingBottom` in the button container:\n  - iOS: 60px (was 40px)\n  - Android: 140px (was 100px) to account for the FloatingTabBar\n\n### 4. **Button Resizing (Proportionate Buttons)**\n- Reduced the red and green action buttons from 70x70 to **56x56 pixels**\n- Adjusted icon size from 32 to **28 pixels** for better proportion\n- Maintained the same visual style with shadows and colors\n\n### Key Features:\n- **Authentication Flow**: Login \u2192 Sign Up \u2192 Email Verification \u2192 Access App\n- **Session Management**: Users stay logged in across app restarts\n- **Protected Routes**: All tabs require authentication\n- **Sign Out**: Available in the Profile tab\n- **Visual Improvements**: \n  - Green background follows active tab\n  - Better spacing for tab bar and buttons\n  - More proportionate button sizes\n\nThe app now requires users to create an account and verify their email before they can swipe through golfer profiles, view matches, or edit their profile!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-10-25T19:22:19Z"}]
