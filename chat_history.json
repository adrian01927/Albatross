Active Tab Indicator:**\n\n*   **Modify `FloatingTabBar.tsx`:**\n    *   Use the `usePathname` hook from `expo-router` to determine the current route.\n    *   Within the `FloatingTabBar` component, conditionally apply a green background style to the tab button that matches the current route. You can use the `selectedTab` state and `setSelectedTab` function to manage the active tab.\n\n**2. Authentication:**\n\n*   **Implement Sign-up/Login:**\n    *   Create dedicated screens for sign-up and login (e.g., `app/auth/signup.tsx`, `app/auth/login.tsx`).\n    *   Use Supabase Auth to handle user authentication.\n    *   Store user session data (e.g., in `AsyncStorage`) to persist login status.\n    *   Wrap the main app content with a conditional rendering that checks for an active user session. If no session exists, redirect to the login screen.\n\n**3. UI Adjustment:**\n\n*   **Modify Layout Components:**\n    *   Adjust the styling of the parent container holding the `FloatingTabBar` and the \"like/pass\" buttons. Use `marginTop` or `paddingTop` to shift the elements downwards.\n\n**4. Button Resizing:**\n\n*   **Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`:**\n    *   Adjust the `width` and `height` styles applied to the red and green buttons within the `HomeScreen` component. Ensure the new sizes maintain visual balance.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-25T19:23:06.427417"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you implement these changes.

Supabase can be configured to handle these providers.\n*   **\"Find a Game\" Tab:** Modify the `FloatingTabBar.tsx` component to include a new tab item for \"Find a Game\".\n*   **Game Management:** Create new screens and components for hosting and joining games. This will likely involve creating new Supabase tables to store game data (players, location, time, etc.).\n*   **Group Chat:** Implement a chat interface using a library like `react-native-gifted-chat` or a custom solution with Supabase's real-time capabilities.\n*   **Invite System:** Generate unique codes or links for each game and implement the logic to handle invitations.\n\nI will now use the agentic search tool to look for relevant code snippets.\n"}, {"type": "file_tree", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/FloatingTabBar.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/auth/login.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/auth/signup.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I have reviewed the existing code.

These screens will include options for Google and Apple sign-in, potentially using Expo's `AuthSession` or `expo-google-sign-in` and `expo-apple-authentication`. Supabase will handle the OAuth flow.\n2.  **\"Find a Game\" Tab:**\n    *   Modify `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to include a \"Find a Game\" tab in the `tabs` array passed to the `FloatingTabBar` component. The tab item should include a `name`, `route`, `icon`, and `label`.\n    *   Create a new screen `app/(tabs)/find-a-game.tsx` for the \"Find a Game\" tab.\n3.  **Game Hosting/Joining:**\n    *   Within `app/(tabs)/find-a-game.tsx`, implement UI elements for hosting and joining games. This might involve buttons, forms, and lists.\n    *   Create new components for displaying game listings and game details.\n4.  **Group Chat:**\n    *   When a user joins or hosts a game, navigate them to a new screen with the group chat.\n    *   Implement the chat interface using a library like `react-native-gifted-chat` or a custom solution with Supabase's real-time capabilities.\n5.  **Invite System:**\n    *   Generate unique codes or links for each game and store them in the Supabase database.\n    *   Implement the logic to handle invitations, allowing users to join a game by entering a code or clicking a link.\n\nI will now use the agentic search tool to look for relevant code snippets.\n"}, {"type": "file_tree", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I have re-examined the code for `FloatingTabBar.tsx` and `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`.\n\nHere's the updated plan, focusing on the immediate next steps:\n\n1.  **Create `app/auth/login.tsx` and `app/auth/signup.tsx`:**\n    *   These files are currently missing.
