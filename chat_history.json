This will likely involve creating a new component to display golfer profiles and handle the swipe gestures.\n3.  **Matching Logic:** Develop the matching logic. When two golfers \"swing right\" on each other, they should be considered a match.\n4.  **Messaging:** Create a basic messaging interface. This might involve creating a new screen or integrating with an existing chat library.\n5.  **Color Scheme:** Apply the specified color scheme to the entire app. This will involve modifying the styles in relevant files (e.g., `styles/commonStyles.ts`, component-specific style sheets).\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app for golfers!\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-24T22:36:50.510847"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a golf-themed Tinder-like app!
